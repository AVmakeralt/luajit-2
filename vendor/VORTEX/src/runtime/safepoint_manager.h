/**
 * VORTEX Safepoint Manager
 * ========================
 *
 * Audit priority #4 (Hardening): "Thread-safe GC — currently uses the_gc
 * global. For concurrent compilation + execution: make GC state thread-local
 * or use read-copy-update. Stop-the-world safepoints must actually pause all
 * mutator threads. Write barrier must be atomic for concurrent marking."
 *
 * This module provides a safepoint manager that coordinates multiple mutator
 * threads for stop-the-world garbage collection. It ensures:
 *
 *   1. When the GC requests a safepoint, ALL mutator threads reach a safe
 *      point before collection begins.
 *   2. Mutator threads check for pending safepoints at regular intervals
 *      (at method entry, loop back-edges, and allocation sites).
 *   3. A thread in a safepoint blocks until the GC releases it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - Main thread: vtx_safepoint_manager_init(&mgr, &gc)
 *   - Each mutator thread: vtx_safepoint_thread_register(&mgr)
 *   - At safepoint check sites: vtx_safepoint_mgr_check(&mgr)
 *   - GC thread: vtx_safepoint_request_all(&mgr) → blocks until all threads
 *     are safepointed → do GC → vtx_safepoint_release_all(&mgr)
 *   - Thread exit: vtx_safepoint_thread_unregister(&mgr)
 *
 * Thread safety: all operations are thread-safe. The manager uses a
 * combination of atomics and a condition variable to coordinate.
