/*
 * VORTEX Safepoint Manager implementation.
 *
 * See safepoint_manager.h for design and audit rationale.
 *
 * Uses a mutex + condition variables to coordinate threads. When a
 * safepoint is requested, mutator threads check the flag and block on
 * the "released" condition variable. The GC thread waits on the
 * "all_safepointed" condition variable until all threads are blocked.
 *
 * The fast path (no safepoint requested) is just an atomic flag check
 * protected by the mutex. In production, this would use a lock-free
 * atomic for the flag, but pthread_mutex is sufficient for correctness.
