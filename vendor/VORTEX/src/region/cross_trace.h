/**
 * VORTEX Cross-Trace Optimization
 *
 * After stitching multiple traces into a hyperblock, this module runs
 * global optimizations across the entire hyperblock. These optimizations
 * are impossible within a single trace because they require seeing
 * computations from multiple paths simultaneously.
 *
 * Optimizations performed:
 *
 *   1. Global Value Numbering (GVN):
 *      - Identifies and eliminates redundant computations that appear
 *        in both the main path and an inlined branch.
 *      - Common subexpression elimination across the entire hyperblock.
 *      - Redundant type check elimination: if a dominating Guard
 *        already proved a type, subsequent type checks on the same
 *        value are eliminated.
 *      - Redundant null check elimination: if a dominating Guard
 *        already proved non-null, subsequent null checks are eliminated.
 *
 *   2. Constant Propagation (SCCP):
 *      - Propagates constants from the main path into branches.
 *      - Folds constant expressions in branch-only code.
 *      - Eliminates dead branches whose condition is constant-false.
 *      - Simplifies Phis that have all-constant inputs.
 *
 *   3. Dead Code Elimination (DCE):
 *      - Removes branch-only computations whose results are never
 *        used on the rejoin path.
 *      - Removes code made dead by constant propagation.
 *      - Iterative: removing dead code may expose more dead code.
 *
 * The overall optimization pipeline:
 *   GVN → SCCP → DCE → GVN → DCE
 *
 * The second GVN pass catches redundancies exposed by constant
 * propagation (e.g., after a branch condition is folded to a constant,
 * both branches may now compute the same value). The final DCE pass
 * removes any newly dead code.

 *   2. SCCP — propagate constants and fold
 *   3. DCE — remove dead code
 *   4. GVN — second pass to catch redundancies exposed by SCCP
 *   5. DCE — remove any newly dead code

 * The hyperblock's node list is NOT updated (it remains as recorded

 * table directly. Callers should re-traverse the graph to find the
