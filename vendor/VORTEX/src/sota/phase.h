/**
 * VORTEX SOTA — Phase Detection + Preemptive Compilation
 *
 * Detects program phases from previous run profiles and preemptively
 * compiles hot methods before they are individually hot in the current run.
 *
 * A "phase" is a set of methods that execute together frequently (detected
 * as SCCs in the call graph). When the current method call pattern matches
 * a known phase signature, all methods in that phase are queued for
 * T2/T3 compilation immediately, even if their individual invocation
 * counts are still low.
 *
 * Wrong predictions have zero cost: compiled code that is never used
 * simply occupies code cache space until evicted. There is no runtime
 * overhead for unused compiled code (it's never entered).
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   1. At startup, load the phase graph from the previous run's profile
 *   2. Monitor the current top-N method call signatures
 *   3. Compute Jaccard similarity between current signature and each
 *      known phase's method set
 *   4. When similarity exceeds VTX_PHASE_MATCH_THRESHOLD, predict that
 *      the program is entering that phase
 *   5. Queue all methods in the predicted phase for compilation
 *   6. Continue monitoring — if the prediction was wrong (methods don't
 *      get called), the compiled code is simply unused (zero cost)
