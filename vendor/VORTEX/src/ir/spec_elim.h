/**
 * VORTEX Speculative Dead Code Elimination (Path Specialization)
 *             and Speculative Exception Elimination
 *
 * This module implements two profile-guided speculative optimizations
 * from the "Maximum Aggression" architecture:
 *
 *   2G -- Speculative Dead Code Elimination (Path Specialization):
 *        Eliminate entire code paths that have never been executed at
 *        runtime. When a branch direction is stable (one direction taken
 *        >= 95% of the time), the compiled code includes only the hot
 *        path, with a trap-based guard that deopts if the cold path is
 *        ever taken. This produces much smaller code, better I-cache
 *        utilization, and eliminates branch mispredictions on the hot path.
 *
 *        Example:
 *          void process(Request req) {
 *              if (req.type == HTTP_GET)  { ... }   95% of traffic
 *              else if (req.type == HTTP_POST) { ... }   4%
 *              else if (req.type == HTTP_PUT)  { ... }   0.9%
 *              else { 20 other HTTP methods }            0.1% -- HUGE CODE
 *          }
 *
 *          After speculative dead code elimination:
 *          -- Generate a version with ONLY the HTTP_GET path
 *          -- Guard: req.type == HTTP_GET (trap-based)
 *          -- All other paths -> deopt -> interpreter handles them
 *          -- Result: MUCH smaller code, better I-cache, no mispredictions
 *
 *   2H -- Speculative Exception Elimination:
 *        Remove all exception handling code from hot paths. When profiling
 *        shows that a call site never (or almost never) throws, the
 *        compiled code omits the exception edge entirely. If the call
 *        ever throws, a trap fires and the interpreter catches the exception.
 *
 *        Example:
 *          After: profile says none of these ever throw
 *          Guard: "no exception" (trap-based, implicit no-throw assumption)
 *          a = obj.method1();   No exception edge in compiled code
 *          b = obj.method2();   No exception edge
 *          c = obj.method3();   No exception edge
 *          If ANY throws -> SIGSEGV/trap -> deopt -> interpreter catches
 *
 * === Integration with Guard Metadata ===
 *
 * Both optimizations integrate with the VORTEX guard metadata system.
 * Each speculative elimination is associated with a guard_id that links
 * to a vtx_guard_meta_t entry. This enables:
 *   - Adaptive strength transitions (FastCheck -> FullCheck -> DeoptAlways)
 *   - Sampling-based profiling (zero-cost deopt hot path)
 *   - Guard dependency tracking for O(dependents) invalidation on deopt
 *
 * === Thread safety ===
 *
 * NOT thread-safe. The caller must synchronize, same as existing
 * guard metadata (vtx_guard_meta_table_t) and speculative PEA.
