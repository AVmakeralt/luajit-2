/**
 * VORTEX Dead Code Elimination (DCE)
 *
 * Removes nodes whose results are never used and that have no side effects.
 * Runs iteratively because removing a dead node may expose more dead nodes
 * (its inputs may lose their last user).
 *
 * A node is kept alive if:
 *   1. It has output_count > 0 (some other node depends on it), OR
 *   2. It has side effects (stores, calls, allocations, guards, etc.), OR
 *   3. It is a control node (structural — defines the control flow graph), OR
 *   4. It is a memory node (defines memory ordering), OR
 *   5. It is pinned (Phi, FrameState — structural position matters), OR
 *   6. It is the Start node or a Parameter projection.
 *
 * A node is dead if:
 *   - output_count == 0 AND none of the above exceptions apply, OR
 *   - It was already marked dead (from a previous pass).
 *
 * When a node is removed:
 *   - Its inputs' output counts are decremented.
 *   - It is marked as dead.
 *   - The iteration continues until no more dead nodes are found.
