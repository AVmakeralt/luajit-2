/**
 * VORTEX SoN → Basic Block Scheduling
 *
 * Converts the Sea-of-Nodes graph back into a scheduled form (basic blocks)
 * suitable for lowering to machine code.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   1. Identify control nodes and build the basic block skeleton.
 *   2. Assign each data node to its earliest legal block:
 *      - Must be in a block that dominates all its uses.
 *      - Must respect memory dependencies (load after store).
 *      - Must be in a block that is dominated by all its inputs.
 *   3. Hoist loop-invariant nodes out of loops.
 *   4. Sink condition-dependent nodes into their target blocks.
 *   5. Place guards as early as possible (fail-fast).
 *   6. Place allocations as late as possible (avoid unnecessary allocation).
 *
 * The schedule is a list of basic blocks, each containing an ordered list
 * of node IDs. The ordering respects data dependencies within the block.
