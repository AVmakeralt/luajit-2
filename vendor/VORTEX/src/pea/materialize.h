/**
 * VORTEX Object Materialization
 *
 * At deoptimization points and escape points, scalar-replaced objects must
 * be reified (materialized) back into real heap objects. This pass inserts
 * NewObject + StoreField nodes into the SoN graph at those points.
 *
 * Materialization is lazy: we only materialize at points where the object
 * actually escapes or where deoptimization requires a concrete heap object.
 * If an object is never used in a way that requires heap identity, no
 * materialization code is generated.
 *
 * When is materialization needed?
 *   1. At Deopt/DeoptGuard nodes: the interpreter expects real objects
 *      on the stack and in locals. If a scalar-replaced object appears
 *      in a FrameState, it must be materialized.
 *   2. At escape points: if an object escapes (e.g., passed as argument
 *      to an unknown function), it must be materialized before the
 *      escape point.
 *   3. At Phi merge points: if a Phi merges a scalar-replaced object
 *      with a non-scalar object, the scalar-replaced one must be
 *      materialized.
 *
 * Materialization code generated for each object:
 *   NewObject(type_id)           → allocate on heap
 *   StoreField(obj, f0, v0)      → store scalar local value into field 0
 *   StoreField(obj, f1, v1)      → store scalar local value into field 1
 *   ...                           → one StoreField per field
 *
 * The resulting heap object is indistinguishable from one that was
 * never scalar-replaced: same type, same field values, same identity
 * (new allocation).
