/**
 * VORTEX Speculative PEA + Lock Elision
 *
 * This module extends the standard Partial Escape Analysis with two
 * profile-guided speculative optimizations:
 *
 *   1. Speculative PEA: For allocations where the standard PEA cannot
 *      prove NoEscape but profiling suggests the object usually doesn't
 *      escape at runtime, speculate that it doesn't escape and add a
 *      guard. If the guard fires (the object actually escapes), deopt
 *      and recompile without the speculation.
 *
 *   2. Speculative Lock Elision: For synchronized methods/blocks where
 *      profiling shows zero (or near-zero) contention, elide the monitor
 *      enter/exit and add a guard that fires if contention is observed.
 *      On guard failure, deopt and recompile with the lock restored.
 *
 * Both optimizations are "zero-cost deopt" features: when the speculation
 * holds (which it usually does, because we only speculate when profiling
 * is confident), the optimized code runs faster than the unoptimized
 * version. When the speculation fails, we pay the deopt cost and fall
 * back to the conservative version.
 *
 * === Speculative PEA ===
 *
 * Standard PEA is conservative: it only scalar-replaces objects that it
 * can PROVABLY prove don't escape (NoEscape). Many objects "technically"
 * escape — e.g., they are passed as arguments to methods — but in practice
 * their identity is never observed by the callee. The callee only reads
 * their fields and never stores the object reference anywhere.
 *
 * Speculative PEA bridges this gap: it uses value profiling data to
 * determine which escaping allocations are likely to be non-escaping in
 * practice, and speculates that they don't escape. A guard is added at
 * each point where the object could potentially have its identity
 * observed. If the guard fires, deopt → recompile without the speculation.
 *
 * Example:
 *   Pair p = new Pair(x, y);      // PEA says ArgEscape (passed to process())
 *   int result = process(p);       // process() only reads p.x and p.y
 *   return p.x + p.y;             // could be scalar-replaced if p doesn't escape
 *
 *   After speculative PEA:
 *   // Guard: p's identity is never observed (trap if it is)
 *   int local_x = x, local_y = y; // scalar replacement
 *   int result = process_fields(local_x, local_y); // rewrite call
 *   return local_x + local_y;      // no allocation, no memory access
 *
 * === Speculative Lock Elision ===
 *
 * Synchronized methods/blocks always acquire and release monitors, even
 * when there's no contention. This is unnecessary overhead for
 * single-threaded or low-contention code paths. Lock elision removes the
 * monitor enter/exit when profiling shows the lock is never contended.
 *
 * Example:
 *   synchronized void update(SharedState s) {
 *       s.counter++;  // Atomic operation
 *   }
 *
 *   After speculative lock elision:
 *   // Guard: no contention on this monitor (trap if contention observed)
 *   void update(SharedState s) {
 *       s.counter++;  // Plain increment — no lock, no atomic
 *   }
 *   // If another thread contends → guard fires → deopt → synchronized version
 *
 * === Integration with Guard Metadata ===
 *
 * Both optimizations integrate with the VORTEX guard metadata system.
 * Each speculative decision is associated with a guard_id that links
 * to a vtx_guard_meta_t entry. This enables:
 *   - Adaptive strength transitions (FastCheck → FullCheck → DeoptAlways)
 *   - Sampling-based profiling (zero-cost deopt hot path)
 *   - Deoptless continuation versions (avoid full deopt on guard failure)
