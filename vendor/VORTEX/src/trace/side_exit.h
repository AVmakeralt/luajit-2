/**
 * VORTEX Side Exit Handling
 *
 * Each side exit represents a point where a compiled trace diverges from
 * the recorded hot path. When the guard at a side exit fails at runtime,
 * execution leaves compiled code and either returns to the interpreter
 * or (if the exit is hot enough) triggers recording of a new trace branch.
 *
 * Side exit lifecycle:
 *   1. Created during trace recording at each untaken branch point.
 *   2. At runtime, a failing guard jumps to a side exit stub that
 *      reconstructs interpreter state and increments the exit counter.
 *   3. When exit_counter > VTX_SIDE_EXIT_THRESHOLD, the side exit
 *      triggers recording of a new trace branch from its PC back to
 *      the loop header, extending the trace tree.
 *
 * The stack state captured at a side exit contains the NodeIDs that
 * represent the interpreter operand stack at the exit point. These
 * are needed to reconstruct the FrameState for deoptimization.
