/**
 * VORTEX Trace Trees
 *
 * A trace tree organizes a root trace (the hot loop body) and branch traces
 * (recorded from hot side exits) into a tree structure. When a side exit
 * from the root trace becomes hot (exit count > VTX_SIDE_EXIT_THRESHOLD),
 * a new trace is recorded from the side exit point back to the loop header.
 * This new trace is linked as a branch of the tree.
 *
 * Trace trees enable cross-iteration optimization:
 *   - The root trace represents the most frequently executed loop path.
 *   - Branch traces handle paths that became hot after initial compilation.
 *   - Tree depth is limited to VTX_MAX_TREE_DEPTH to prevent compile-time
 *     explosion.
 *
 * Tree structure:
 *
 *   [Loop Header]
 *       │
 *       ▼
 *   ┌──────────┐
 *   │ Root     │ ← recorded from loop header, follows hot path
 *   │ Trace    │
 *   └──┬───┬───┘
 *      │   │
 *   ┌──┘   └──┐
 *   ▼          ▼
 * ┌─────┐  ┌─────┐
 * │Branch│  │Branch│ ← recorded from hot side exits
 * │  0  │  │  1  │
 * └─────┘  └─────┘
 *
 * Each branch trace starts at the side exit point and is expected to
 * eventually loop back to the loop header (closed branch). If a branch
 * trace doesn't loop back, it's an open branch (method exit).
