/**
 * VORTEX Speculative Value Propagation Through the Heap (Level 2A)
 *
 * This is the single biggest optimization VORTEX doesn't have.
 *
 * Current VORTEX: constant propagation works on local values. If obj.x = 42,
 * the compiler doesn't know that a later load obj.x returns 42 — it might have
 * been mutated.
 *
 * Aggressive version: Profile the ACTUAL VALUES stored in fields. If obj.x
 * has been 42 in 99.7% of observations, SPECULATE that it's always 42:
 *
 *   // Source code:
 *   int sum = obj->x + obj->y;  // Two memory loads
 *
 *   // After speculative value propagation:
 *   // Guard: obj->x == 42 && obj->y == 7 (observed values)
 *   int sum = 42 + 7;           // CONSTANT FOLD → sum = 49
 *   // ZERO memory loads. ZERO cache misses.
 *
 * This is exponentially powerful when chained:
 *   // Before: 4 memory loads, 2 branches, 1 call
 *   if (config->mode == PRODUCTION) {          // load + branch
 *       result = cache->compute(input->data);  // load + load + call
 *   }
 *
 *   // After speculative value propagation:
 *   // Guard: config->mode == PRODUCTION, cache->algo == FAST, input->type == INT
 *   // All guards are trap-based (zero cost on hot path)
 *   result = fast_int_compute(input->data);  // Inlined, devirtualized, constant-folded
 *   // 1 load, 0 branches, 1 inlined call
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   - Each (type_id, field_offset) pair has its own value profile with 4 slots
 *   - This extends value_profile's 2-slot design to 4 for better coverage
 *   - Heap value profiles are keyed by (type_id, field_offset) because the
 *     same field on different types can have very different distributions
 *   - A field_id is computed as (type_id << 32 | field_offset) for compact storage
 *   - Sampling reduces hot-path overhead to ~1 cycle per observation
 *
 * Observation flow:
 *   1. Interpreter/profiler calls vtx_heap_value_prop_observe_hot() at each LoadField
 *   2. Hot path: decrement counter, return (highly predictable branch)
 *   3. On sample boundary: slow path updates the top-4 values and frequencies
 *   4. After each slow-path update, check stability (top value freq > 95%)
 *   5. If stable, mark as speculation candidate and record the speculated value
 *
 * Compilation flow:
 *   1. Compiler queries vtx_heap_value_prop_is_stable() for each LoadField
 *   2. If stable, replace LoadField node with a constant (the speculated value)
 *   3. Emit a value guard (trap-based) that verifies the speculated value
 *   4. Register the guard via vtx_heap_value_prop_install_guard()
 *   5. Guard dependency graph tracks the relationship (guard → value site)
 *   6. On deopt, guard_deps records the value site for re-materialization
 *
 * Thread safety: NOT thread-safe. The caller must synchronize, same as
 * existing guard metadata (vtx_guard_meta_table_t) and value profiles
 * (vtx_value_profile_table_t).
