/**
 * VORTEX Guard Dependency Graph — O(dependents) Invalidation on Deopt
 *
 * When a guard fails at runtime and deoptimization occurs, the runtime needs
 * to identify and invalidate exactly the code that depended on the failed
 * guard — not the entire compiled version. This module pre-computes which
 * optimizations depend on each guard, enabling O(dependents) invalidation
 * instead of O(all_nodes) graph traversal.
 *
 * The four categories of guard-dependent optimizations are:
 *
 *   1. Inline sites — method calls that were inlined because this guard
 *      guaranteed the receiver type. If the guard fails, these inlined
 *      methods need to be "un-inlined" (deopt to interpreter at the call site).
 *
 *   2. Scalar replacement objects — allocations that were scalar-replaced
 *      because this guard proved they don't escape. If the guard fails,
 *      these objects need to be materialized back on the heap.
 *
 *   3. Branch PCs — branches that were eliminated (replaced with unconditional
 *      jumps) because this guard proved the branch direction. If the guard
 *      fails, these branches need to be restored.
 *
 *   4. Value sites — loads that were constant-folded because this guard
 *      guaranteed the loaded value. If the guard fails, these loads need
 *      to be re-materialized from memory.
 *
 * Building the graph:
 *   The graph is built during the compilation pipeline, after all optimizations
 *   have been applied. The builder walks the SoN graph and, for each DeoptGuard
 *   node, identifies:
 *     - CheckCast/InstanceOf nodes at the same bytecode_pc
 *     - Data nodes that take the guard's condition as input
 *     - Inlined MethodCall nodes devirtualized by this guard
 *     - Allocate nodes scalar-replaced because this guard proved NoEscape
 *     - If nodes whose branch was eliminated because this guard proved condition
 *     - LoadField nodes constant-folded based on a value guard
 *
 * Thread safety: NOT thread-safe. The caller must synchronize, same as
 * existing guard metadata (vtx_guard_meta_table_t).
