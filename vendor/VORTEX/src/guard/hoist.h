/**
 * VORTEX Adaptive Guards — Guard Hoisting
 *
 * Hoists loop-invariant guards out of loops during SoN optimization.
 * A guard is loop-invariant if all its inputs are defined outside the loop.
 * When such a guard is found, it is moved to the loop's preheader.
 *
 * This optimization reduces the overhead of repeated guard checks inside
 * hot loops. For example:
 *
 *   for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
 *     guard(obj != null);     // hoisted: obj doesn't change in the loop
 *     guard(obj.type == A);   // hoisted: obj.type doesn't change in the loop
 *     sum += arr[i];          // stays: arr[i] depends on i
 *   }
 *
 * After hoisting:
 *   guard(obj != null);
 *   guard(obj.type == A);
 *   for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
 *     sum += arr[i];
 *   }
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   1. For each loop in the schedule (blocks with loop_depth > 0)
 *   2. For each Guard/DeoptGuard node in the loop body
 *   3. Check if all inputs to the guard are defined outside the loop
 *      (all inputs' defining blocks have loop_depth < guard's loop_depth)
 *   4. If so, move the guard to the loop's preheader block
 *   5. Update the schedule accordingly
 *
 * Safety: A guard can only be hoisted if failing it earlier (before the loop)
 * is safe — i.e., the guard would have also failed inside the loop.
 * This is guaranteed when all inputs are loop-invariant, because the
 * guard's condition would evaluate to the same value regardless of position.
 *
 * A guard must NOT be hoisted if:
 *   - It depends on a value computed inside the loop
 *   - It is a bounds check that depends on the loop index
 *   - Its failure would cause a different deopt state than if checked in-loop
 *     (the FrameState must still be valid at the new position)
